# Lead_Scoring_case_Study
X Education has appointed us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

This github repository contains a logistic regression model built for X Education to help the company prioritize potential leads based on their likelihood of conversion. It includes code for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, as well as recommendations for utilizing the model effectively.
